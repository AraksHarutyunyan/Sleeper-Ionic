UX Decisions:

- Display list by year
- Both calendar and list views -- calendar is first
- Different coloured event markers on calendar
- Modal (should this be push notification if off app?) data entry requests to make recording painless
- If push notification, should be quick enough to really not need to go into app except check progress and stats
